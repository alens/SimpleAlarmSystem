# SimpleAlarmSystem
Arduino based home Alarm System managed over Bluetooth 

The code is mostly for me, so i can have always a handy access to the code and info :)

The current version 1.0 is quite simple, We Arm/Disarm the alarm using a mobile android app over BT. the version 2.0 will have the ESP-01 wifi 
module for arming/disarming and sending push notification (using adafruit API) if there is any event detected.
